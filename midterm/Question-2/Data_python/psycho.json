Anyone who glances down the list of movies available at theaters this summer can find half a dozen with Roman numerals II and III as part of their names. What is unusual about ''Psycho II,'' which has just finished production at Universal, is that it is being made 22 years after Alfred Hitchcock's classic psychological thriller. Most sequels arrive on the screen within two or three years of their predecessor. The actors who played the original villain and heroine, Anthony Perkins and Vera Miles, are recreating their roles two decades later. In the opening moments of ''Psycho II'' Mr. Perkins's Norman Bates is being released from a hospital for the criminally insane against the wishes of Miss Miles, the sister of Janet Leigh, the woman he murdered 22 years ago.","abstract":null,"print_page":"17","blog":[],"source":"The New York Times","multimedia":[],"headline":{"main":"AFTER 22 YEARS, 'PSYCHO' SEQUEL"},"keywords":[{"name":"subject","value":"MOTION PICTURES"}],"pub_date":"1982-08-11T00:00:00Z","document_type":"article","news_desk":"Cultural Desk","section_name":"Movies; Arts","subsection_name":null,"byline":{"person":[{"organization":"","role":"reported","firstname":"Aljean","rank":1,"lastname":"HARMETZ"},{"organization":"","role":"reported","rank":2}],"original":"By ALJEAN HARMETZ, Special to the New York Times"},"type_of_material":"News","_id":"4fd125938eb7c8105d5ebbb8","word_count":1265,"slideshow_credits":null}]},"status":"OK","copyright":"Copyright (c) 2013 The New York Times Company.
