The final entry in the ''Lord of the Rings'' trilogy reveals once more that what the chick flick is to men, this trilogy is to women -- or at least to a large secret society of us for whom the series is no more than a geek-fest, a technologically impressive but soulless endurance contest. That holds even for the newest, least nerdy installment, ''The Return of the King'' (or as those of us with our priorities straight like to think of it, ''The Return of Viggo,'' our one consolation). The film arrived in a cloud of media hype that included a full hour on ABC's ''Prime Time,'' Elijah Wood (Frodo) as host on ''Saturday Night Live,'' Viggo Mortensen (Aragorn, the King) on the cover of Vanity Fair and the tiresome, inevitable Oscar buzz. Like the two earlier installments, it also arrived with unmistakable social pressure to gush over its sheer size and spectacle.
