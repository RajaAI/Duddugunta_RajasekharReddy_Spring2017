Think back to the 60's and students pretending to be Vietnamese peasants. But the post-modern era has its rewards. Among them is the acting of the Lesbian Avengers, some of it deadly serious, some deliciously silly. Fire-eating, their dramatic trademark, grew out of tragedy. Last year, a lesbian and a gay man, Hattie Mae Cohens and Brian Mock, burned to death in Salem, Ore., after a Molotov cocktail was tossed into the apartment they shared. A month later, on Halloween, at a memorial to the victims in in New York City, the Avengers (then newly organized) gave their response to the deaths. They ate fire, chanting, as they still do: \"The fire will not consume us.

As embodied, quite literally and quite luminously, by Diana Rigg in the arch 1960's spy-fi show ''The Avengers,'' she was the first and arguably the last woman on television to combine sensuality with ironic intellect. Tall and cool and defiantly self-reliant, Mrs. Peel -- ''the widow of a famous test pilot'' -- was fluent in nine languages (including kung fu), could tie knots in mastermind-bending schemes and shoot the cork off a champagne bottle at 50 paces. In two seasons of battling eccentric British megalomaniacs bent on taking over the world, she always struck while the irony was hot. Her banter was fierce, often distancing. When Mrs. Peel's genteel partner, John Steed, offered her services to an enemy agent, the agent scoffed: ''She is your choice?''","abstract":"Franz Lidz article on new movie version of 1960's television series The Avengers compares Uma Thurman to Diana Rigg; photos (M)","print_page":"11","blog":[],"source":"The New York Times","multimedia":[],"headline":{"main":"Sorry, Uma, There's Only One Emma","kicker":"FILM"},"keywords":[{"name":"creative_works","value":"AVENGERS, THE (MOVIE)"},{"name":"creative_works","value":"AVENGERS, THE (TV PROGRAM)"},{"name":"persons","value":"THURMAN, UMA"},{"name":"persons","value":"RIGG, DIANA"},{"name":"subject","value":"MOTION PICTURES"},{"name":"subject","value":"TELEVISION"}],"pub_date":"1998-08-09T00:00:00Z","document_type":"article","news_desk":"Arts and Leisure Desk","section_name":"Movies; Arts","subsection_name":null,"byline":{"person":[{"organization":"","role":"reported","firstname":"Franz","rank":1,"lastname":"LIDZ"}],"original":"By FRANZ LIDZ"},"type_of_material":"News","_id":"4fd1ec758eb7c8105d73e028","word_count":1049,"slideshow_credits":null},{"web_url":"http:\/\/query.nytimes.com\/gst\/abstract.html?res=9B03E7DF153EEE3BBC4D53DFB766838C659EDE","snippet":"IN 1944, while the Germans still occupied Denmark, a novel was published in Copenhagen with the title, \"Ways of Retribution.\" It was an accomplished piece of story-telling, intricate in pattern, yet simply and luminously set forth....","lead_paragraph":"IN 1944, while the Germans still occupied Denmark, a novel was published in Copenhagen with the title, \"Ways of Retribution.\" It was an accomplished piece of story-telling, intricate in pattern, yet simply and luminously set forth.","abstract":"Andrezel, P; Angelic Avengers","print_page":"BR9","blog":[],"source":"The New York Times","multimedia":[],"headline":{"main":"Adventures of Lucan and Zosine; Of Lucan and Zosine"},"keywords":[{"name":"creative_works","value":"ANGELIC AVENGERS"},{"name":"creative_works","value":"ANGELIC AVENGERS"},{"name":"persons","value":"ANDREZEL, P"},{"name":"persons","value":"ANDREZEL, P"},{"name":"subject","value":"BOOKS AND LITERATURE"},{"name":"subject","value":"REVIEWS"},{"name":"subject","value":"BOOKS AND LITERATURE"},{"name":"subject","value":"REVIEWS"}],"pub_date":"1947-01-05T00:00:00Z","document_type":"article","news_desk":null,"section_name":null,"subsection_name":null,"byline":{"person":[{"firstname":"Robert","middlename":"Gorham","lastname":"DAVIS","rank":1,"role":"reported","organization":""}],"original":"By ROBERT GORHAM DAVIS"},"type_of_material":"Review","_id":"4fc2866945c1498b0d6d61c8","word_count":1292,"slideshow_credits":null},{"web_url":"http:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/1990\/12\/29\/world\/sniper-hits-3-west-bank-arabs.html","snippet":"An Arab doctor was shot and seriously wounded Thursday night as he was traveling in a car with his sister and her baby 10 miles south of here in the occupied West Bank, the police and the army said today.

But this year, Marvel's superhero team ''The Avengers'' will be the final act of the annual gathering, on April 28. ''The Avengers,'' starring Robert Downey Jr., Chris Evans, Mark Ruffalo, Scarlett Johansson and Samuel L. Jackson, was directed by Joss Whedon, best known for the television series ''Buffy the Vampire Slayer.'' The comic, first published in 1963, unites Iron Man, the Incredible Hulk, Thor, Hawkeye, Black Widow and Captain America to battle evildoers. The movie, which will be released nationally on May 4, is expected to be one of the biggest box-office draws this summer. As part of the publicity extravaganza, the festival is inviting what it calls ''everyday heroes'' from uniformed agencies and the military to attend the screening and meet the cast. ''Marvel's 'The Avengers' is an exciting ride that absolutely transports audiences,'' Jane Rosenthal, one of the founders of the festival, said in a statement. ''It is the perfect way to end our 11th Festival.'' More information can be found on the festival Web site.","abstract":"Action movie The Avengers is scheduled for closing night of the Tribeca Film Festival.

''The Avengers'' is Warner Brothers' would-be blockbuster that has actually had its light hidden beneath a bushel until opening day, and no wonder. With pseudo-suave repartee that would make Austin Powers blush and with so many shades of ''Howard the Duck'' that one scene depicts man-size pastel teddy bears sitting around a conference table, it's a film to gall fans of the old television series and perplex anyone else. I can't remember another Friday morning show where I heard actual cries of ''Ugh!'' on the way out the door.","abstract":"Janet Maslin reviews film The Avengers, based on television series; photo of Ralph Fiennes as John Steed and Uma Thurman as Emma Peel (S)","print_page":"7","blog":[],"source":"The New York Times","multimedia":[],"headline":{"main":"Shh!
