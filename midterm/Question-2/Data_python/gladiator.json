After all, Mr. Phoenix has gotten almost as much buzz for his two bizarre appearances on late-night talk shows last year, in which he rambled incoherently at times, as he has for his Oscar nomination for playing a corrupt emperor's son in ''The Gladiator.''

Mr. Phoenix is finally located, 25 blocks uptown at Armani, getting fitted for the tuxedo he will wear to the Academy Awards ceremony on March 25. He could not be more apologetic as he calls, sounding quite lucid, on his cell phone, and races downtown for the interview. For this child of hippies, the third of five siblings who moved with his family 40 times in 20 years, the duties and obligations that come with an Oscar nomination are apparently a bit overwhelming.
