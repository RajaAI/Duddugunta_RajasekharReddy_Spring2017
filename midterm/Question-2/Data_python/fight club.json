Where ''American Beauty'' hinges on the subversive allure of a rose-covered blond cheerleader, Mr. Fincher has something a good deal tougher in mind. The director of ''Seven'' and ''The Game'' for the first time finds subject matter audacious enough to suit his lightning-fast visual sophistication, and puts that style to stunningly effective use. Lurid sensationalism and computer gamesmanship left this filmmaker's earlier work looking hollow and manipulative. But the sardonic, testosterone-fueled science fiction of ''Fight Club'' touches a raw nerve. In a film as strange and single-mindedly conceived as ''Eyes Wide Shut,'' Mr. Fincher's angry, diffidently witty ideas about contemporary manhood unfold. As based on a novel by Chuck Palahniuk (and deftly written by Jim Uhls), it builds a huge, phantasmagorical structure around the search for lost masculine authority, and attempts to psychoanalyze an entire society in the process. Complete with an even bigger narrative whammy than the one that ends ''The Sixth Sense,'' this film twists and turns in ways that only add up fully on the way out of the theater and might just require another viewing. Mr. Fincher uses his huge arsenal of tricks to bury little hints at what this story is really about.","abstract":"Janet Maslin reviews movie Fight Club directed by David Fincher; Brad Pitt and Edward Norton star; photo (M)","print_page":"14","blog":[],"source":"The New York Times","multimedia":[],"headline":{"main":"Such a Very Long Way From Duvets to Danger","kicker":"FILM REVIEW"},"keywords":[{"name":"creative_works","value":"FIGHT CLUB (MOVIE)"},{"name":"persons","value":"FINCHER, DAVID"},{"name":"persons","value":"NORTON, EDWARD"},{"name":"persons","value":"PITT, BRAD"},{"name":"subject","value":"MOTION PICTURES"},{"name":"subject","value":"REVIEWS"}],"pub_date":"1999-10-15T00:00:00Z","document_type":"article","news_desk":"Movies, Performing Arts\/Weekend Desk","section_name":"Movies; Arts","subsection_name":null,"byline":{"person":[{"organization":"","role":"reported","firstname":"Janet","rank":1,"lastname":"MASLIN"}],"original":"By JANET MASLIN"},"type_of_material":"Review","_id":"4fd201988eb7c8105d766244","word_count":936,"slideshow_credits":null},{"web_url":"http:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/2002\/09\/29\/magazine\/the-way-we-live-now-9-29-02-questions-for-chuck-palahniuk-the-pugilist-novelist.html","snippet":"Q: Your new book, ''Lullaby,'' is a darkly comic, subversive take on the horror genre and features a more or less unwitting serial killer.
