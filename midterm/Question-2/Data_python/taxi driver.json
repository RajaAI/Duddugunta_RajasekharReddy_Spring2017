Hindsight underscores the amazing prescience of Martin Scorsese's \"Taxi Driver,\" a film that anticipated such profound changes in our national mood. Since its debut, \"Taxi Driver\" and Travis Bickle, a tortured innocent dpiven over the brink into shocking violence, have come to seem far less marginal than they did in 1976. The spiritual perils invoked by Paul Schrader's daring, cautionary screenplay have come closer to home. Yet for all its invective against urban decay, \"Taxi Driver\" is also brilliantly acted and rhapsodically beautiful, which accounts for so much of its staying power. Mr. Scorsese's vision of a shimmering, neon-lighted purgatory remains as haunting as ever, thanks also to the power of Bernard Herrmann's unforgettable score. The stunning New York of \"Taxi Driver\" still looks both seductive and terrible, a physical manifestation of the forces tearing Travis apart.", "_id": "4fd1d9b68eb7c8105d719801", "print_page": "12", "source": "The New York Times", "pub_date": "1996-02-16T00:00:00Z", "slideshow_credits": null, "news_desk": "Weekend Desk", "document_type": "article"}, {"section_name": "Movies; Magazine", "web_url": "http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9F02E5DA143DF931A15756C0A9679D8B63", "type_of_material": "News", "blog": [], "keywords": [{"name": "creative_works", "value": "TAXI DRIVER (MOVIE)"}, {"name": "persons", "value": "SCHAPIRO, STEVE"}, {"name": "persons", "value": "FOSTER, JODIE"}, {"name": "persons", "value": "FOSTER, CONNIE"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "MOVIES"}], "abstract": "Kathy Ryan What They Were Thinking interview with Jodie Foster and her sister Connie, who are depicted in a photograph taken by Steve Schapiro on the set of the movie Taxi Driver; photo (M)", "headline": {"kicker": "WHAT THEY WERE THINKING", "main": "Sisters on a movie Set, New York, 1975"}, "subsection_name": null, "byline": {"original": "By KATHY RYAN", "person": [{"role": "reported", "firstname": "Kathy", "rank": 1, "organization": "", "lastname": "RYAN"}]}, "snippet": "Jodie Foster (right): I was thinking what a dumb thing it was to put my sister in an outfit to be my double in ''Taxi Driver.''
