Strong candidates in the best actress category are elusive, to put it mildly, while prize-worthy male actors are hard to miss. This raw deal doesn't work to anyone's advantage. While leading actresses languish or play thankless roles, men continue to tough it out in the most competitive of all movie awards categories: best supporting actor. This year turned out to be a particularly brutal one for supporting actor candidates and once again we see why these secondary roles boast a disproportionate share of talent. For one thing, good supporting roles are easier to write than leading ones, because they needn't be fully rounded or carry a story.

This is not to say that Mr. Tarantino has lost his taste for hair-raising excess, only that he now has it much more firmly in check. \"Pulp Fiction\" remains bracingly off kilter as it mixes lurid, outrageous elements with sweetly appealing ones, to the point where the viewer never has the faintest idea what to expect.
