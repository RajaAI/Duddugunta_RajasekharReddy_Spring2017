Mr. Cameron, the filmmaker behind the 3-D blockbuster ''Avatar,'' joined 20th Century Fox in announcing that he would make ''Avatar 2'' and ''Avatar 3'' as his next two movies, with the first of the sequels scheduled for release in December 2014, and the second for December of the following year. That assures a lot of fantasy-filled Decembers, as Peter Jackson has already scheduled a pair of ''Hobbit'' films for Warner Brothers and Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer in that month in the years 2012 and 2013. ''Avatar'' was released on Dec. 18 of last year and became the highest-grossing film in history, with almost $2.8 billion in worldwide ticket sales. Mr. Cameron and the top Fox film executives, Jim Gianopulos and Tom Rothman, jointly said they aimed to begin production next year on the first sequel. The film is not yet officially titled, they said. This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.","abstract":"Avatar filmmaker James Cameron confirms plans with 20th Century Fox to make Avatar 2 and Avatar 3, for successive December releases in 2014 and 2015 (S)","print_page":"3","blog":[],"source":"The New York Times","multimedia":[],"headline":{"main":"Cameron Announces Two 'avatar' Sequels","kicker":"ARTSBEAT"},"keywords":[{"name":"creative_works","value":"AVATAR (MOVIE)"},{"name":"persons","value":"CAMERON, JAMES"},{"name":"subject","value":"MOVIES"}],"pub_date":"2010-10-28T00:00:00Z","document_type":"article","news_desk":"The Arts\/Cultural Desk","section_name":"Movies; Arts","subsection_name":null,"byline":{"person":[{"organization":"","role":"reported","rank":1,"firstname":"Michael","lastname":"CIEPLY"}],"original":"By MICHAEL CIEPLY"},"type_of_material":"News","_id":"4fd2b7988eb7c8105d8accf5","word_count":182,"slideshow_credits":null},{"web_url":"http:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/1998\/06\/29\/business\/compressed-data-the-fine-art-of-luring-readers.html","snippet":"Want to learn how to put an end to junk E-mail forever?
